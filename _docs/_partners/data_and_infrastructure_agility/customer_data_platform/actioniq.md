## Integrations

### Audience Membership

This integration is used to sync ActionIQ audience membership to Braze by creating custom attributes that denote whether a Braze profile is part of a segment. Each ActionIQ audience corresponds to a unique boolean custom attribute.

The standard naming convention for the custom attribute created is: `AIQ_<Audience ID>_<Split ID>`.

To create a segment of these users, in Braze, navigate to **Segments**, create a new segment, and select **Custom Attributes** as your filter. From here, you can choose the ActionIQ custom attribute. After the segment is created, you can select it as an audience filter when creating a campaign or Canvas.

Additionally, this integration will update any Custom or Standard attribute in a user's Braze profile with their ActionIQ attribute values.

#### Requirements

_Required Permissions:_ `users.track` and `user.export.ids`

In ActionIQ, set up a Braze connection by providing your REST API key and Braze REST endpoint. 

To match to consumers in the Braze platform, the following identifiers must be included in your activation setting:
- `braze_id`
- `external_id`

### Events

The ActionIQ platform can be configured to receive event information through its streaming ingest service. This integration option forwards these Events to Braze, for marketers to use for orchestration or the triggering of marketing campaigns.

The event integration is able to send additional ActionIQ attributes as part of the properties within the event payload.

#### Requirements

_Required Permissions:_ `users.track` and `user.export.ids`

The events integration sends the following information to Braze:
- Event name
- Consumer identifier (either `braze_id` or `external_id`)
- Timestamp
- Event properties, which are populated by any additional attributes in the export setting

### Triggered Campaigns

This integration will trigger a Campaign in Braze for all users in an ActionIQ segment. Once you have configured your Campaign's copy, multivariate testing and re-eligibility rules, you can trigger it from any ActionIQ Journey touchpoint by just adding the Braze Campaign ID to your export setting.

Optionally, you can include any other ActionIQ attributes in your export to populate your Campaign copy. Those are sent via the `trigger_properties` object.

#### Requirements

_Required Permissions:_ `campaigns.trigger.send` and `campaigns.list`

The following values must be sent in your ActionIQ export to Braze:
- Consumer identifier (either `braze_id` or `external_id`)
- Campagin ID
